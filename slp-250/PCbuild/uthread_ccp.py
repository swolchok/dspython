"""Python Microthread Library, version 0.1
Microthreads are useful when you want to program many behaviors
happening simultaneously. Simulations and games often want to model
the simultaneous and independent behavior of many people, many
businesses, many monsters, many physical objects, many spaceships, and
so forth. With microthreads, you can code these behaviors as Python
functions. Microthreads use Stackless Python. For more details, see
http://world.std.com/~wware/uthread.html"""
