  $Log: spi.c,v $
  Revision 1.3  2006/10/05 18:03:14  wntrmute
  corrected readFirmware

  Revision 1.2  2006/06/26 02:06:30  wntrmute
  use correct register defines

  Revision 1.1  2006/02/06 22:29:32  joatski
  Added writePowerManagement, readPowerManagement, and readFirmware to serial.h, as well as some associated defines.

  Created spi.c to contain the code for these two.
